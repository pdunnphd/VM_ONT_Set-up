This file is to give an overview of setting up an Instance (VM) for running sequencing analysis.

1. Log in to your Nectar account
2. Select "Instances" (Highlighted yellow section on left-hand side)
3. Select "Launch Instance"
4. Fill out the Details tab
  Note: This must include a new Instance Name and Count
5. Source details - click on the upward facing arrow to the right of the OS/Kernel that will be used for the VM
  Note: I predominantly have been using the NeCTAR Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) amd64 or NeCTAR Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) - make sure these are compatible with any downstream packages/applications
6. Select "Flavour" - This provides information on how powerful the VM will be. For Nanopore sequencing applications I recommend a minimum of 8Gb RAM and 30Gb Root Disk space
7. Select "Key Pair" - This is a generate authenticator that is highly recommended for running your VM. These can be generated using Putty or through the command line, or through Nectar
8. Launch Instance
